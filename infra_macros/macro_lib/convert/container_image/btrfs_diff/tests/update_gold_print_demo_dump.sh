# `test_parse_dump.py` also checks that we are able to parse the output of a
# live `btrfs receive --dump`, but the specific **sequence** of lines it
# produces to represent the filesystem is an implementation detail, and may
# change, since there is not a _uniquely_ correct way of doing it.
#
# So instead of testing parsing on a live `print_demo_dump.sh`, which would
# always be at risk of breaking arbitrarily, we do two things:
#  - Via this script, we freeze a sequence from one point in time just
#    for the sake of having a parse-only test.
#  - To test the semantics of the parsed data, we test applying a live
#    sequence to a mock filesystem, which should always give the same result.
