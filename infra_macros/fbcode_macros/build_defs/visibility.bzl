    Gets the default visibility for a given base_path.

    If the base_path is an experimental path and isn't in a whitelist, this
    ensures that the target is only visible to the experimental directory.
    Otherwise, this returns either a default visibility if visibility_attr's
    value is None, or returns the original value.

    Args:
        visibility_attr: The value of the rule's 'visibility' attribute, or None
        name_attr: The name of the rule
        base_path: The base path to the package that the target resides in.
                   This will eventually be removed, and native.package() will
                   be used instead.
